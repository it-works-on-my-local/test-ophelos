- Ruby 3.1.2
- Rails 7.1.2
- PostgreSQL


### app/views
- income_expenditures/edit.html.erb: View file for editing Income and Expenditure statements.
- income_expenditures/index.html.erb: Displays a table of all Income and Expenditure statements.
- income_expenditures/new.html.erb: View file for creating a new Income and Expenditure statement.
- Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates)

### app/controllers
- income_expenditures_controller.rb: Handles HTTP requests for managing Income and Expenditure statements.

### app/models
- expenditure.rb: Model for Expenditure data, including validations and associations.
- income_expenditure.rb: Model for Income and Expenditure data, including validations, associations, and custom methods.
- income.rb: Model for Income data, including validations and associations.
- config/routes.rb: Defines the application routes, including RESTful routes for managing Income and Expenditure statements.

### db/schema.rb
- Auto-generated schema file representing the database structure having details about the models and table contents

###  Spec
- Controller: spec/controllers/income_expenditures_controller_spec.rb
- Models: 
  - spec/models/expenditure_spec.rb
  - spec/models/income_expenditure_spec.rb
  - spec/models/income_spec.rb
- Factories:
  - spec/factories/expenditures.rb
  - spec/factories/income_expenditures.rb
  - spec/factories/income_expenditures.rb
  - spec/factories/users.rb

### Gemfile
Lists all the gems used in the project, including Rails, Bootstrap, Devise, and testing-related gems.
Gems Added

- Bootstrap: Enhances the application's UI with a responsive design and pre-styled components.
- Devise: Provides user authentication and management functionality.
- Autoprefixer-Rails: Ensures cross-browser compatibility for CSS styles.
- Font Awesome Sass: Adds scalable vector icons for a visually appealing UI.
- Simple Form: Simplifies form creation with a concise syntax.
- Factory Bot Rails: A testing library for creating consistent and reusable test data.

### Thought Process

#### Pragmatic Gem Selection

Carefully selected gems such as Devise and Bootstrap were chosen to streamline the development process and enhance user experience. The inclusion of Autoprefixer-Rails ensures consistent styling across different browsers.

#### Testing Strategy

RSpec and Factory Bot Rails were employed to maintain a robust testing suite. This enables the creation of reliable and reusable test data, ensuring the application's stability and functionality.

#### Scaling Considerations

Anticipating future growth, the project is designed with scalability in mind. Strategies include optimizing database queries, implementing caching mechanisms, and considering a microservices architecture for independent scalability.

## Scaling for the Future

As the Income Expenditure Tracker grows, scalability becomes a crucial consideration. Here are strategies for scaling the application:

- **Database Optimization:** Regularly review and optimize database queries to ensure efficient performance, especially as the dataset expands.
- **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce load times and enhance the app's responsiveness.
- **Load Balancing:** Introduce load balancing to distribute incoming web traffic across multiple servers, ensuring optimal performance and preventing server overload.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Consider transitioning to a microservices architecture, allowing different components of the application to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Scaling Database Infrastructure:** As the user base grows, consider scaling the database infrastructure, possibly using sharding or dedicated database clusters.
- **CDN Integration:** Implement a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute static assets globally, reducing latency and improving page load times.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Scale horizontally by adding more application servers to handle increased traffic and user load.
- **Monitoring and Analytics:** Implement robust monitoring tools to track application performance, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions for scaling.
